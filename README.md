In this project i'll be making an webpage from scratch as instructed by the foundations-landing-page lesson on the foundations course found on the Odin Project website. They have a pre-made design and layout image that we should follow, but we are free to choose our own theme. The theme of my choice will be an adventure tourism in the form of scuba diving.
